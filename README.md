# ☕ Have A Chai

**Have A Chai** is a developer-focused platform inspired by [BuyMeACoffee.com](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/), built as a portfolio project to showcase my full-stack web development skills. This project is not a commercial product or business, but a technical demonstration deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
